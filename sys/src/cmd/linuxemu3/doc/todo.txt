- AF_INET6
	i dont need that too yet

- VDSO
	we could gain quite a performance hit when we can avoid
	the trapping overhead and let linux-code directly jump
	in linuxemu handler.

- dsp / mixer
	implement mixer ioctls in devdsp
	mmap and trigger caps for quake

- ptrace
	implement ptrace support so we can use native debugger
