.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Trfs
translates 9P requests exchanged between a client and a file
server. The translation replaces spaces seen in remote file names 
to a different rune. The same is done with left and right parenthesis,
ampersands and single quotes.
.PP
The rune used instead of space within file names
can be selected by specifying it as an option.
.PP
.I Trfs
reaches the server through the
.I servename
file or through a network connection to the 
.I addr
address given to the
.B -n
option. 
The client mounts the file posted by
.I trfs
in
.IR srv (4).
The file posted is named
.B /srv/trfs
by default, but it can be 
.B /srv/\fIsrvfile\fP 
when the option
.B -s
is used, and also
.B /srv/\fIaddr\fP when the option
.B -n
is given.
.PP
Option
.B -v
instructs
.I trfs
to print to standard error a human readable copy of messages exchanged. This
makes
.I trfs
useful to debug file servers. The
.B -D
option enables debug messages.
.SH EXAMPLE
These examples dial a foreign system, start
.IR trfs ,
and mount it at
.B /n/remote.
Names like
.B "/n/remote/music/alan parsons" 
that contaning blanks
would be renamed to names like
.B "/n/remote/music/alan‚ê£parsons."
.PP
.EX
	srv tcp!foreign
	trfs -s foreign.tr /srv/tcp!foreign
	mount -c /srv/foreign.tr /n/remote

	trfs -n tcp!foreign
	mount -c /srv/tcp!foreign /n/remote

.SH BUGS
Spaces in remote file names are not caught when found inside file
names or other media. The rune used instead of space might be used
in remote file names leading to confussion. The same happens with remaining
runes subject to translation.
