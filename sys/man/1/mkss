.SH NAME
mkss \- create an executable shell script and open it in the editor.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mkss filename
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mkss
creates a shell script with the name specified by
.I filename
in $home/bin/rc/, then uses
.IR plumb (1)
to send the script to the user's editor. The script's permissions are executable.
.SH SOURCE
.B /rc/bin/mkss
.SH BUGS
It might be nice if mkss took scripts from stdin, making it possible to quickly turn a bunch of frequently used commands into a shell script. 
.LP
Right now
.I mkss
is primarily used for making utility scripts. It might be useful to add installing to /rc/bin as an option as well.
