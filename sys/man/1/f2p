.SH DESCRIPTION
These are some tools to help write C programs in Plan 9. They are all installed
under
.BR /bin/c .
Many of them use standard input if no file is given as an argument, and are suitable
for use within
.IR acme (1).
.TF s/mktypedefs
.TP
.B s/argsused
generates a
.I USED(x)
sentence for each argument in the functions found in the input files or standard input.
.TP
.B s/badexterns
receives a series of object files as arguments and locates external symbols
used in just one file. Those should perhaps be declared as static symbols.
.TP
.B s/badglobals
receives a series of object tiles as arguments and locates global symbols that
appear to be unused. They could probably go.
.TP
.B s/enum2sw
receives as input a declaration of values (e.g., part of declarations within a
.IR enum )
and generates a
.I switch
statement for them.
.TP
.B s/f2p
generates a prototype declaration for each non-static function found in the input.
.TP
.B s/p2f
does the opposite, and writes an empty function definition for each prototype found in the input.
.TP
.B s/ifs
gets rid of spaces that should not be there according to the Plan 9 C style.
.TP
.B s/mkdeps
generates dependencies for
.I mk (1)
according to
.I include
directives found in the input.
.TP
.B s/mktypedefs
generates
.I typedef
declarations for each
.I struct
definition found in the input.
.TP
.B s/psort
sorts prototypes by name.
.TP
.B s/rep
repeats the text found in the input so that
.I from
is replaced each time by one of the values given as
.I to .

.SH BUGS
Many. All these tools are tiny shell scripts and do not perform much error
checking. Also, they assume code is written using the style of
Plan 9 from Bell Labs source code.
