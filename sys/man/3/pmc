.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.I pmc
device serves a two-level directory, giving
access to the hardware counters on the
different cores.
There is a directory per core,
.B coreNNNN,
containing files
pertaining to that core.
.PP
The
.B ctrNN
files provide access to the value of the counters.
The corresponding control file configures the counter.
It accepts the following commands:
.TP
.B reset
Clears the configuration for the counter disabling any possible
feature it has.
.TP
.B user
The counter only runs when the processor is in user space.
.TP
.B os
The counter only runs when the processor is in the kernel.
.TP
.BI "set configuration
Sets the counter configuration. The detail of what the configuration
means is left to the specific implementation of the counter. Reading the
.B ctrdesc
file, gives back some common possible configurations for
this particular driver and processor, one per line.
.TP
.BI enable
Enables the counter which both makes it to start running and enables
any other way to access the counter from user space, like special
instructions.
.PP
Any change to or from the counters or the configurations is seen
as soon as possible. In the worst case, it is guaranteed that the values
read or set are at least as fresh as the last time a process went in or out
of the kernel on that core.
.PP
Configure the counter 0 to count L2 misses in the kernel.
